    "## QUES 1) Discuss string slicing and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    " String slicing in Python is a way to extract a specific portion of a string. To slice a string, you use square brackets [ ] with the start and end index separated by a colon : inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how string slicing works:\n",
    "- The start index is the position where the slicing begins (inclusive).\n",
    "- The end index is the position where the slicing ends (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit the start index, Python will start from the beginning of the string. If you omit the end index, Python will slice until the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through some examples to make it clearer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_string[1:5])\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output: \"ello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Omitting start or end index:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Python is awesome\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_string[:6])\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output: \"Python\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_string[7:])\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output: \"is awesome\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using negative indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Snapchat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_string[-3:])\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output: \"hat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Slicing with a step parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Programming\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_string[0:10:2]) \n",
    "\n",
    "#Output: \"Pormn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " In Python, indexing starts from 0, and negative indices count from the end of the string."

    "## QUES 2) Explain the key features of lists in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are a versatile and fundamental data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a collection of items. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Ordered Collection*:\n",
    "Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted, allowing you to access elements by their index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Mutable*:\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Heterogeneous Elements*:\n",
    "Lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Dynamic Sizing*:\n",
    "Lists can grow or shrink dynamically as you add or remove elements, making them flexible for various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Indexing and Slicing*:\n",
    "You can access individual elements in a list using their index. Slicing allows you to extract a sublist by specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Common Operations*:\n",
    "Lists support various operations like appending elements, extending lists, removing elements, sorting, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "To access, modify, and delete elements in a list in Python, you can use indexing and specific list methods. Here are the explanations and examples for each operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Accessing Elements*:\n",
    "   To access elements in a list, you use square brackets [] with the index of the element you want to retrieve. Remember that indexing starts at 0 in Python.\n",

    "   There are multiple ways to delete elements from a list:\n",
    "   - Using del statement: Removes an element at a specific index.\n",
    "   - Using remove() method: Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "   - Using pop() method: Removes and returns the element at a specific index.\n",

    "## QUES 4) Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples\n",

    "1. *Definition*:\n",
    "   - Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, and remove elements after the list is created.\n",
    "   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values.\n",

    "   - Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Examples*:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - List Example:\n",
    "   python\n",

    "## QUES 8) Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The immutability of dictionary keys in Python is essential because it ensures the integrity and consistency of the dictionary. When a key is immutable, it means that the key's value cannot be changed after it is created. This property is crucial for dictionary keys because it allows Python to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why dictionary keys being immutable is important:\n",
    "1. *Hashing*: Dictionary keys are hashed to determine their storage location in the dictionary. Immutable keys ensure that the hash value remains constant, allowing for quick retrieval of values associated with the keys. If keys were mutable, changing a key's value could lead to inconsistencies in the hash table, making it challenging to retrieve the associated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Uniqueness*: Immutable keys guarantee that each key in a dictionary is unique. If keys were mutable and their values could change, the uniqueness of keys would be compromised, leading to potential conflicts and incorrect retrieval of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Consistency*: Immutable keys provide consistency in dictionary operations. Once a key is set, you can rely on its value to remain the same throughout the dictionary's lifetime. This predictability is crucial for maintaining the dictionary's structure and ensuring the correct functioning of key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of immutable types that can be used as dictionary keys in Python include:\n",
    "- *Strings*: \n",

    "e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'Alice'}\n",

    "e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {(1, 2): 'Tuple key'}\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, mutable types like lists cannot be used as dictionary keys because their values can change, leading to unpredictable behavior in dictionary operations.\n",
